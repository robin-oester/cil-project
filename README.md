Project work for the ETHZ CIL Collaborative Filtering 2024 competition held on kaggle. The goal of the project is to correctly predict the movie ratings for given (user, movie)-pairs.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Quickstart
For local development, you need to have [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) installed. Then, run
```bash
conda env create -f ./environment.yml
conda activate cil-project

# for contributing
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
chmod +x run_code_compliance.sh
```

## üìÇ Project Organization
- ```data/data_train.csv``` holds the training data with (Id,Prediction) tuples. The Id consists of a given (user, movie) rating. For example r44_c1 refers to the rating of the 44-th user for the 1st movie. The movie ratings are integer values ranging from 1-5.
- ```data/sampleSubmission.csv``` is a sample submission file. It holds the Ids, for which the predictions have to be made.
